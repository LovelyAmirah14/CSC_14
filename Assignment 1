When making the hello world file I made a command print("Hello World)
and didn't include the " to see the error that it would provide. I got 
a Syntax error essentially meaning there was a key factor missing from
the code that would make it false when run. The second example I made and
typo for print("Hello World"); and it didn't give me an error and to why
I can make an inference it has to do with the coding world end results
like in java when you finish and want to print something that ; is included
to complete the code or else you will get syntax error.
